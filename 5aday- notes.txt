5-A-Day: The effect on physical and mental well-being

Individual A- Control (<5-a-day)

Individual B- Control (>5-a-day)

Individual C-Reduced to less than 5-a-day (usually had 5-a-day)

Individual D- Reduced to less than 5-a-day (usually had 5-a-day)

Individual E- Increased to 5-a-day (usually had <5-a-day)

Individual F- Increased to 5-a-day (usually had <5-a-day)

How does fruit and vegetable intake affect:

1) Sugar

2) Vit C

3) Calories

4) Weight after

5) Average egestion

6) Energy levels

7) Mood

8) BP

Do fruit and vegetable intake affect genders differently?

-Mood, energy levels, calories, BP, etc

Weight loss/gain- association with calories, fruit and vegetable intake

If we say thatâ€¦

Ideal systolic is 90-120

Ideal diastolic is 60-80

Improved mood is better mental well-being

Improved energy levels are better

Maintenance of weight (or in some cases gain/loss) is better physical well-being.

Does consuming an average of 5 fruit and veg a day improve overall well-being?

Can we then subdivide into mental and physical well-being

Do individuals that reduce to 5-a-day see a similar trend? Is this similar to the control who has <5-a-day?

Do individuals that increase to 5-a-day see a similar trend? Is this similar to the control who has >5-a-day?
